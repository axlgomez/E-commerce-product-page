# E-commerce product page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

Here I have built out this e-commerce product page.

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
